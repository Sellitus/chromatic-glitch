# User Stories & Implementation Guide for Chromatic Glitch: The Unknown

## Automated Pipeline Setup

Before diving into implementation, let's establish a robust pipeline that will support the agentic coder throughout development.

### `pipeline.sh` Script

Create a comprehensive pipeline script with the following components:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Chromatic Glitch Development Pipeline
# Usage: ./pipeline.sh [option]
#   Options:
#     clean - Run code formatting and linting fixes
#     test  - Run all tests
#     full  - Complete pipeline (default)

# Set error handling
set -e

# Determine execution mode
MODE=${1:-full}

# Color definitions for output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Functions for each pipeline stage
# [detailed functions would be implemented here]

# Main execution logic
case $MODE in
  clean)
    run_cleanup
    ;;
  test)
    run_tests
    ;;
  full)
    run_cleanup
    run_tests
    ;;
  *)
    echo -e "${RED}Invalid option: $MODE${NC}"
    echo "Usage: ./pipeline.sh [clean|test|full]"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

The script should implement these functions:

1. **run_cleanup**: Code quality improvements including:
   - Code formatting (Prettier)

   - UI component tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Memory leak detection

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing "Chromatic Glitch: The Unknown" through bite-sized, testable user stories. Each story builds upon previous ones to gradually construct a complete game experience, with a focus on the unique music modification system that forms the core of the gameplay.

The automated pipeline ensures code quality and comprehensive testing throughout development, allowing the agentic coder to quickly identify and fix issues. By following this structured approach, the implementation can proceed methodically while maintaining high quality standards.

Remember to run `./pipeline.sh` regularly during development to ensure code quality and catch issues early. The full pipeline will:
1. Format and clean code
2. Run static analysis and type checking
3. Check for common issues and anti-patterns
4. Run the comprehensive test suite
5. Generate test coverage reports

This ensures that each story is fully functional before moving to the next, creating a solid foundation for this innovative musical roguelike game.
