## 3. Dynamic Music Generation System

### Music Track Architecture

The music system requires special attention as it's a central gameplay element. Create a robust architecture that allows cards to modify music during combat:

- **Base Track Library**:
  - Create 8-10 pre-composed music tracks in different styles:
    - Calm/Meditative tracks for low-severity encounters
    - Tense/Rhythmic tracks for moderate encounters
    - Intense/Complex tracks for severe encounters
  - Each track should be 3-5 minutes long and loopable
  - Compose tracks with clear instrument separation for stem isolation

- **Stem Separation**:
  - Each music track must be split into 6-8 independent stems:
    - Percussion (rhythmic elements, drums)
    - Bass (low-frequency foundation)
    - Lead Melody (primary musical themes)
    - Harmony (chord progressions, pads)
    - Texture (ambient sounds, atmospheric elements)
    - Vocals (when applicable)
    - Accents (transitional elements, stingers)
  - All stems must be properly synchronized and balanced
  - Store stems as high-quality OGG or MP3 files (44.1kHz, 16-bit)

### Dynamic Audio Processing

## 9. Music Modification Details

Since the music system is central to the gameplay experience, here's a detailed breakdown of how cards should modify the music:

### Card Type Music Effects

**Melody Cards (Offensive)**:
- **Soothing Whisper**: Apply subtle high-pass filter to melodic elements, slightly reduce percussion volume
- **Rising Tone**: Gradually shift pitch upward on lead instruments, increase brightness
- **Drum Flourish**: Intensify percussion tracks, add accent hits, boost rhythmic elements
- **Ancestral Chorus**: Add layered harmonies to melody stems, introduce vocal elements

**Harmony Cards (Defensive)**:
- **Minor Shield**: Add reverb to create space, introduce subtle delay on harmonic elements
- **Pain Barrier**: Apply low-pass filter on harsh elements, add sustained pad textures
- **Tranquil Sphere**: Create circular panning effect, enhance harmonic richness
- **Ancestral Embrace**: Apply deep reverb, add ambient pads, reduce percussion intensity

**Rhythm Cards (Utility)**:
- **Gentle Tap**: Introduce subtle rhythm variation, accent certain beats
- **Pattern Shift**: Restructure rhythmic elements, modify time signature feel
- **Echo Chamber**: Add synchronized delay effects to percussion, create rhythmic echoes
- **Resonant Cycle**: Modulate tempo slightly, increase rhythmic complexity

**Resonance Cards (Rare/Powerful)**:
- **Ancestral Memory**: Apply complex effect combining previous card effects
- **Disease Binding**: Create dramatic drop in intensity with filter sweep
- **Soul Synchronization**: Apply harmonic reinforcement, synchronize all effects to master rhythm

### Progressive Transformation Implementation

The key to the music system is how these effects accumulate during combat:

1. **Initial State**: Combat begins with clean, unmodified music appropriate to the patient/disease

2. **Early Transformation (First 3-5 cards)**:
   - Subtle modifications are applied
   - Effects are minimal and focused on single stems
   - Original composition remains clearly recognizable
   - Example: Light filtering, minor rhythmic variations

3. **Mid-Combat Transformation (Next 5-8 cards)**:
   - Effects become more pronounced
   - Multiple stems are being modified simultaneously
   - Audio begins to take on a unique character
   - Example: Noticeable rhythm changes, harmonic shifts, spatial effects

4. **Late Combat Transformation (Remaining cards)**:
   - Heavy modification of all stems
   - Original composition serves only as a foundation
   - Dramatic, potentially experimental sound emerges
   - Example: Glitch effects, significant tempo/pitch changes, extreme filtering

5. **Resolution State**: By the end of combat, the music should be dramatically transformed from its original state, creating a unique sonic journey that reflects the specific cards played during that encounter.

### Dice-Music Interaction

Implement special audio events triggered by dice combinations:

- **Pair**: Subtle accent or flourish on a single stem
- **Two Pair**: Complementary accents on different instrument stems
- **Three of a Kind**: More pronounced musical shift, add a new layer
- **Straight**: Sequential melodic run or arpeggio that follows the straight pattern
- **Full House**: Major musical shift, add significant new elements
- **Four of a Kind**: Dramatic break or drop, followed by intensity increase
- **Five of a Kind**: Complete transformation of all stems, peak musical moment

## 10. Technical Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement audio processing efficiency measures:
  - Use Web Audio API's native nodes when possible
  - Process audio in chunks for custom effects
  - Implement dynamic quality scaling based on device performance
  - Cache processed audio when possible

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Address browser-specific implementations:
  - Create fallbacks for unsupported Web Audio API features
  - Test across major browsers
  - Implement feature detection with graceful degradation
  - Consider polyfills for missing functionality

### Mobile Optimization
- Adapt for mobile platforms:
  - Touch-friendly controls for card and dice manipulation
  - Address mobile audio limitations (autoplay restrictions)
  - Optimize processing for lower-powered devices
  - Implement battery-efficient audio approaches

### Testing Framework
- Develop comprehensive testing strategies:
  - Unit tests for core systems

  - Performance benchmarks for audio processing
  - User testing protocols for gameplay balance

## Conclusion

This implementation guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating a fully functional prototype of "Chromatic Glitch: The Unknown" using JavaScript. The music system is designed to be particularly dynamic, allowing cards played during combat to progressively transform a base musical composition through cumulative effects on individual instrument stems.

By following this guide, an agentic coder would have clear direction on implementing all game systems with special emphasis on the audio transformation mechanics that make each combat encounter a unique musical journey. The final prototype should deliver on the core promise of the game: a deeply emotional experience where music serves both as gameplay mechanic and emotional storytelling medium.
